### M.S. Arizona State University, Tempe. raghavendran2652 AT gmail DOT com.

### Short Bio:

I am a graduate student at Arizona State University. I am currently working with Dr. Hemanth Venkateshwara at [Centre for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC)](https://cubic.asu.edu/). I am particularly interested in  Multi Modal Representation learning. I previously was working as a Business Intelligence(BI) Developer at Accenture.

### Interests:

* Developing intelligent agents and representations that can enable learning from multiple modalities (such as Vision & Language) at the same time (Multi-Modal representation learning).
* Developing objectives that can facilitate learning specific representations using naturally occurring labels in data (Self-Supervised Learning).
* Understanding and enhancing mechanisms (such as attention) for cross-modal applications such as Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering.
